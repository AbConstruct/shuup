# Shuup 2.0

Thanks for stopping by Shuup. As we lead up to our **epic 2.0 release**, we have closed our source code for the current development period. We want to ensure the best possible experience during the 2.0 transition and as such we took it offline to prepare. 

Stay tuned for updates on the release, including the long-awaited, scalable **multivendor marketplace**!

We are happy to share the current source code for Shuup version 1.2 upon request. Please contact us by email at <contact@shuup.com>.
